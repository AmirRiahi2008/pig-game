## 🎯 Overview

**Pig Game** is a fun and interactive web-based dice game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Two players take turns to roll a dice. On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they want, accumulating points in a **current score**. If they roll a 1, they lose their current score and it's the other player's turn. They can also choose to **hold**, adding their current score to their total. First player to reach 30 points wins!

This game is a great project to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript.
